          How WebNest is Revolutionizing Small Businesses: A Success Story from
          Top's China
        </h1>
        <p><em>By Ethan Greenwald</em></p>
        <p>
          In the digital-first economy of today, small businesses are at an
          ever-growing need to mark their presence online. For most of them,
          especially the local restaurants and service providers, the absence of
          an effective digital strategy implies lost opportunities and
          stagnation. That is where WebNest comes in: a nonprofit organization
          empowering small businesses with professional-grade websites and
          digital resources for free. Probably one of the biggest success
          stories to come out of this organization is to be found in Top's
          China, a family-owned Chinese restaurant that has seen its business
          grow remarkably after partnering with WebNest.
        </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Located in the heart of its community, Top's China had built a loyal
          customer base through its reputation for delicious food and excellent
          service. Like many small businesses, though, the restaurant struggled
          to adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape. They relied on
          traditional word-of-mouth marketing and outdated methods for managing
          orders and customer engagement. The absence of an ordering platform or
          social media outlet prevented them from tapping into the market that
          was increasingly looking for convenience and digital interactions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Minimum Visibility:</strong> They did not have a
            professional website or proper online presence. Thus, visibility
            through search engines was minimal to attract new customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inefficient Order Management:</strong> Orders were mostly
            taken over the phone and hence prone to miscommunication and
            inefficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unable to Compete on Delivery Platforms:</strong> While most
            of their competitors utilized DoorDash and other similar platforms,
            Top's China did not have the capability to optimize their menu for
            online audiences or to increase delivery efficiency.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Realizing the potential for more, Top's China reached out to WebNest
          for help.
        </p>

        <h2>The WebNest Solution</h2>
        <p>
          At WebNest, we adopt a holistic approach towards solving the digital
          problems of small businesses. The plan for Top's China included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Design a Professional Website:</strong> WebNest designed
            Top's China an elegant and user-friendly website. We implemented:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A perfect flow and intuitively designed layout to show menu,
                services, and time of operation;
              </li>
              <li>
                A highlighted "Order Now" button directed to online ordering
                systems;
              </li>
              <li>
                SEO optimization integrated into the website ensured that it
                appeared topmost in local searches, including terms such as
                "Chinese food near me."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smoothening Online Orders:</strong> WebNest integrated an
            online ordering platform right into the website. The customers would
            face no hassle in placing orders via the website, reducing the
            staff’s workload and minimizing errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimizing DoorDash Integration:</strong> WebNest optimized
            Top's China's DoorDash listing by:
            <ul>
              <li>Adding professional photos of their most popular dishes;</li>
              <li>Optimizing the menu with descriptions and pricing;</li>
              <li>
                Enhancing promotional strategies, including limited-time offers
                to drive traffic.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing and Branding:</strong> WebNest provided social
            media templates to assist Top's China in establishing and
            maintaining a coherent brand identity. We also guided them on

            testimonials.
          </li>
        </ul>
